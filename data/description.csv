Precise trade-offs,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/decisions-with-multiple-objectives/tradeoffs-under-certainty/63531BB0093A8674D12FE2A6F9FF88B4,"Trade-offs method (direct) is based on the comparison of alternatives which perform differently on two criteria (assuming the performances on the other criteria is fixed). The method is applied with a survey where the respondent is asked to indicate if two alternatives are indifferent. In case they are not, the respondent can indicate which alternative he/she would prefer and then change one of the values in a way that would make alternative A as good (or as bad) as alternative B."

Precise SWING,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597884710879,"SWING weighting refers to the change of evaluation of performance on each criterion from one value to a different one (typically from the worst to the best value).
The method considers a fictitious alternative that performs the worst on all the criteria and asks the respondent to indicate which criterion he/she would prefer to improve from its worst value to its best. This swing is assigned 100 points. The respondent is then asked to indicate which criterion of the fictitious alternative would be the second most important one he/she would like to improve from its worst to its best value. He/she should also assign a swing from 0 to 100 to indicate how important that change would be. The process continues until all the criteria are rank ordered in terms of their attractiveness on the 0-100 swing. The assigned points to each criterion are then summed up and used to normalize each criterion on a 0-100 scale."

Ranking,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ads/2012/276584/,"Criteria are ranked from most to least important. The weights are derived afterwards usually by using one of the following methods: rank sum, rank reciprocal, or rank exponent."
AHP,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037722179090057I,"Criteria are compared on a pairwise comparison basis with a pre-defined semantic scale (the original is 1-9). The higher the importance of a criterion with respect to the other, the higher is the score. After these comparisons are completed, a matrix is derived based on this set of comparisons (K x K, where K is defined as the set of criteria).  The value of the weights is then derived based on the eigenvector of the matrix. The value of the weights is then derived based on the eigenvector of the matrix. The respondent is also provided with a measure of the inconsistency in the given pairwise comparisons."

The DM is asked to place by decreasing order of importance a deck of cards, each card representing one criterion. Ties are allowed for criteria judged to be equally important. The DM can also place blank cards between other cards in the ranking to indicate a greater difference in importance. Finally, the DM should indicate how many times the most important the first criterion (or group of criteria) is, relatively to the last ranked criterion (or group of criteria)."

Averting behaviour,"https://www.iso.org/standard/43243.html;
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264085169-en;
https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402014451","Taken from Dickie (2017), with some changes: 
Methods based on averting behavior (or avoidance, defensive, mitigating, or protective behavior) take as their main premise the notion that individuals and households can insulate themselves from a non-market bad by selecting more costly types of behavior. These behaviors might be more costly in terms of the time requirements they imply, or of the restrictions they impose on what the individual would otherwise wish to do. Alternatively, individuals might be able to avoid exposure to non-market bads via the purchase of a market good. These financial outlays are known as defensive expenditures. The value of each of these purchases represents an implicit price for the non-market good or bad in question.
Note that ISO 14008 distinguishes three kinds of averting cost methods. Here only the one is described whose costs accrue due to individual averting behavior while methods relying on costs decided by public bodies are treated under “abatement costs”.  Further note that according to ISO 14008, these costs may be used for monetary valuation only after a spending or a commitment to spending will have been made."

Hedonic Pricing,https://www.iso.org/standard/43243.html; http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264085169-en; https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402014451,"Taken from Taylor (2017) and ISO 14008: Heterogeneous or differentiated goods are products whose characteristics vary in such a way that there are distinct product varieties even though the product is sold in one market (e.g., cars, computers, houses). The variation in product variety gives rise to variations in product prices within each market. The hedonic method relies on market transactions for these differentiated goods to determine the implied value or implicit price of characteristics. The hedonic pricing method uses statistical methods to isolate the implicit “price” of each of these characteristics. The most common application of hedonic theory in environmental valuation involves housing markets. The choice of housing location and, therefore, neighborhood amenities (such as scenic views, less air or noise pollution), is observable. The method can also be applied to labor markets in particular with respect to risks of death."
CRITIC,https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/0305-0548(94)00059-H,CRITIC stands for “Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation”. The method considers the standard deviation of each normalized criterion (contrast intensity) and the linear correlation between them (conflict).

The efficiency score (eco-efficiency, or other) involves weighting multiple indicators. Each system under evaluation is allowed to choose the weighting vector that makes it compare in the best possible way against its peers. This is done by optimizing the efficiency score for each system under assessment with the weights as variables to be set. The system is deemed to be efficient if no other systems perform better given the chosen weights vector. DEA when used in the context of composite indicator construction is named “‘Benefit-of-the-Doubt’ approach."
Entropy,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-48318-9,"The method relies on the information theory to measure the amount of useful information that can be obtained. When the evaluated alternatives have a great difference between each other on a particular impact category indicator, the entropy is smaller, meaning that the impact category indicator provides more effective information, and therefore, the weight value corresponding to that indicator should be larger. On the contrary, when the differences are smaller, the entropy is larger, which shows that the amount of information provided by the indicator is smaller, and therefore, its weight value should be correspondingly smaller."
Factor Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-017-1832-9; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.068; https://www.oecd.org/sdd/42495745.pdf ,"Factor analysis (FA) is a multivariate analysis method similar to principal components analysis (PCA). It has been widely used to reduce the dimensionality of the data by identifying unknown latent variables to explain the original data.  Contrary to the PCA, which is based simply on the linear combination of the data, FA assumes that the data is based on the underlying factors of the model, and that the data variance can be decomposed into the variance accounted for by common and unique factors. Each factor is defined as a set of coefficients (so-called loadings), each measuring the correlation between the individual impact category indicators and the latent factor. Furthermore, FA is often used when there is interest in studying relations among the variables, while PCA is used when there is a greater emphasis on data reduction and less on interpretation.
The weights allocated to each impact category indicator are determined according to the proportion of its variance that is explained by the factor it is associated to. The largest factor loadings are allocated to the impact category indicators with the largest variation across the dataset, whereas smaller factor loadings are allocated to the impact category indicators with less variation across the dataset."

The linear combinations of the original indicators are called principal components. The factor loading of the first principal components are rotated to minimize the number of individual variables that have a high loading on the same component. These factors are generally considered the indicators weights. Furthermore, the largest factor loadings are assigned to the indicators with the largest variation across the dataset, whereas smaller factor loadings are assigned to the indicators with less variation across the dataset."

For example, Karl Pearson’s correlation ratio (also known as the first order sensitivity index) is calculated with respect to the composite indicator, i.e., the index obtained from the aggregation of the individual indicators. This correlation ratio is a coefficient of nonlinear association and can be considered as ex post measure of importance."

The basis for weighting in EDIP 97 is political environmental targets within each impact category (set as a reduction in society´s impact on the environment) and considers only binding targets. The original set of weighting factors was defined for Denmark. Weighting is performed only at midpoint level (EDIP methodology only has indicators at this level).
