Meaning of weights*compensation rates#They indicate the weight of one unit in the respective impact category indicator result (e.g., per 1 kg of CO2 equivalents or 1 kg of SO2 equivalents). If Wx is the weight of 1 unit in impact category indicator x and Wy is the weight of 1 unit in impact category indicator y, then 1 unit of x is worth the same as (Wx/Wy) units in y. This type of weighting factor is used by methods where being better in one impact category indicator result can compensate for being worse in another impact category indicator. For example, W could be USD/CO2-eq for climate change or â‚¬/DALY for respiratory inorganics. Other examples are the W of climate change expressed in kg of CO2-eq with a weight of 1 and the W of acidification per kg of SO2-eq with a weight of 2. This expression means that the improvement of 2 units (i.e., 2 kg of CO2-eq) of climate change compensates for the worsening of 1 unit (i.e., 1 kg of SO2-eq) of acidification.
Meaning of weights*importance coefficients#They indicate the intrinsic importance of the impact indicator itself when comparing two or more alternatives. If an impact category indicator is given more weight than another one, then it is more important to be better in this impact category indicator than in another. This type of weighting factor is used by methods where being better in one impact category indicator result may or may not fully compensate for being worse in another impact indicator. For example, W for climate change could be 35%, W for ozone depletion could be 15% and W for eutrophication could be 20%, etc., with the meaning that being better in terms of climate change (alone) is as important as being better in terms of ozone depletion and eutrophication (simultaneously).
