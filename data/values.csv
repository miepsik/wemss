Meaning of weights#compensation rates#importance coefficients
Temporal discounting#yes#no
Cultural differentiations#yes#no
Independence from the set of systems being evaluated#yes, weights should be independent from the set of systems being evaluated#no, weights can be dependent on the set of systems being evaluated
Reproducibility of the weights#replicates should provide same/similar results#replicates can also provide quite (~ 10%) similar results#replicates do not need to provide similar results
Scientific validity#published in a peer-reviewed journal or book#published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings#not peer-reviewed is fine
Method transparency#all method algorithms and value choices should be explained#method algorithms and value choices can be partly explained#no transparency is needed, no method algorithms or value choices need to be explained
Coverage of glam areas of protection#all glam areas of protection should be covered#not all glam areas of protection can be covered
Uncertainty characterization#the uncertainties should be characterized stochastically#the uncertainties should be characterized, but stochastic characterization is not required#characterization of uncertainties is not required
Communicability#the meaning and calculation of the weights must be easy to communicate#at least, the meaning and calculation of the weights should not be hard to communicate#the communication of the meaning and calculation of the weights is not a concern
Accounting for differences in utility for the same impact#the method can assign different weights to the same impact experienced by individuals living in different socio-economic contexts to reflect their loss of utility#the method cannot assign / should not assign different weights to the same impact experienced by individuals living in different socio-economic contexts to reflect their loss of utility
Area of protection metrics#weights should be directly related or relatable to the area of protection metrics#weights are not directly related, but can be adapted to relate to the area of protection metrics#weights are not directly related or relatable to the area of protection metrics
Geographical resolution#national differentiation#continental differentiation#no geographical differentiation
Global coverage#global weights should be obtained#global weights can be calculated from non-global weights#no global weights are needed
Application demonstrated in case studies#widely used in case studies#used just in a few (e.g., three or four) case studies#it is ok if it has not been used in any case studies
Available resources to apply the method#limited time, cost and manpower available#notable time and/or cost and/or manpower available#extensive time, cost and manpower available
Available technical and calculation infrastructure#simple infrastructure#both simple and complex infrastructure#complex infrastructure
Representativeness#the method should work with a representative sample of the affected population#the method does not need to work with a representative sampling of the affected population
Bias#no known biases can be accepted#known biases that can be corrected can be accepted#known biases that cannot be corrected can be accepted
